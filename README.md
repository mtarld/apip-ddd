# Domain Driven Design and API Platform 3

An example project of **Domain Driven Design** using **API Platform 3** and following the **hexagonal architecture**.

This example has been explained during the [API Platform conference 2022](https://api-platform.com/con/2022/conferences/domain-driven-design-with-api-platform-3/)
([slides](https://slides.com/mathiasarlaud/apip-con-ddd-api-p-3), video).

## Getting started
If you want to try to use and tweak that example, you can follow these steps:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/mtarld/apip-ddd` to clone the project
1. Run `make install` to install the project
1. Run `make start` to up your containers
1. Visit https://localhost/api and play with your app!

## Contributing
That implementation is pragmatic and far for being uncriticable.
It's mainly an conceptual approach to use API Platform in order to defer operations to command and query buses.

It could and should be improved, therefore feel free to submit issues and pull requests if something isn't relevant to your use cases or isn't clean enough.

To ensure that the CI will succeed whenever contributing, make sure that either static analysis and tests are successful by running `make ci`
